Gutenberg CSS Modification
==========================

- I changed the background and font color to some more pleasuring colors and enlarged the font to a more user-friendly size.
- I changed the font to a serif font which is easier to read except the book information part.
- I setted different color from the article body to the headers and the image captions.
- I setted the image caption in the center of the screen.
- I setted the contents of the book aligning to the center.
- I rearranged the postion of the picture with CSS to make sure they are in a right position as the original CSS shows.
